# uMessage User Guide

*uMessage* is an app that helps university students manage contacts, academics and CCAs that communicate and hold meetings on various platforms. It is optimized for keyboard users.

## Features

### Search

Once you start typing in the search bar (except when you type a command word), *uMessage* will search through all names and tags.

Example:
When you enter `a`, all contacts with `a` in their name or tags will be listed.

The command word `find` will do the same task, i.e., entering `a` in the search bar is equivalent to entering `find Al`.
However, if your keyword is also a command word, then you have to use `find` so that *uMessage* will search for the keyword.
