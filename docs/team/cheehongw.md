### Project: uMessage
uMessage is a desktop app that helps university students manage contacts, academics and CCAs that communicate and hold meetings on various platforms. It is optimized for keyboard users.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature:** Make the list of persons selectable

  - What it does: Allows the user to directly view the detailed contact information of any person in the contact list simply by clicking with the mouse or navigating with the arrow keys.

  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently browse and see detailed information, improving the information density our product is able to deliver.

  - Highlights: This enhancement requires understanding of the observer pattern used in the GUI framework and FXML.

* **New Feature:** Add ability to add and remove individual tags from a person
  - What it does: Allows the user to create and delete individual tags in the application
  - Justification: As part of the target user profile, this a key feature that allows the user to organise the contacts in the address book.

* **New Feature:** Add `SocialMedia` to `Person`

* **New Feature:** Filter list by clicking a tag label
